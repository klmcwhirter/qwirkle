# qwirkle - rules

Bag of 108 tiles = 6 colors * 6 shapes * 3 copies of each

## Shapes

- Circle
- Criss-cross
- Diamond
- Square
- Starburst
- Clover

## Colors
- Red
- Orange
- Yellow
- Green
- Blue
- Purple

## Setup
* Shuffle all the tiles
* Each player draws 6 tiles to start their hand
* Each players' hand should only be visible to them

## Deciding who starts
* Each player counts the tiles in their largest group - same color OR same shape
* Player with the largest group goes first
* If there is a tie, the oldest person goes first
* The first player places 1 or more tiles in a line to start the grid
* the first turn ends with the first player drawing as many tiles as needed from the bag to "fill the hand" back to 6 tiles

## Turn rules
* turns proceed clockwise around the table
* a line must contain:
	* tiles with the same shape OR color
	* must not contain any duplicates (shape OR color)
	* a max of 6 tiles in the line - called a Qwirkle
* tiles must be placed in one single line, but points can be scored for multiple lines as appropriate
* the turn ends with the player drawing as many tiles as needed from the bag to "fill the hand" back to 6 tiles

## Exchange for turn
* the player may opt to exchange as many pieces from their hand as they like for new tiles from the bag
* place the replaced tiles back into the bag
* since their hand once again has 6 tiles, the turn ends

## End game
Once the bag is empty play continues until one players' hand becomes empty.
Note that since the bag is empty it is not possible to replace played pieces.

## Scoring
The player counts 1 point for each tile in the line where the tile(s) were placed.
If the tile(s) connected with other lines count the tiles in those lines also.
6 additional points are awarded for each Qwirkle constructed as a result of the turn - line of 6 tiles (shape OR color)

The player who plays the last tile from their hand scores points as normal plus 6 bonus points for the game end.
